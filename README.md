# AI-Oriented Software Development Environment

Currently, most AI coding systems like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Buddy work through existing human-oriented IDEs:

- They interact with text-based code representations
- They generate code that fits into file structures designed for humans
- They're constrained by interfaces optimized for human cognition and interaction

## Why This Isn't Optimal for AI

Human-oriented IDEs aren't necessarily ideal for AI because:

1. AIs don't benefit from many IDE features designed for human limitations (syntax highlighting, visual organization)
2. AIs can process abstract code representations that might be more efficient than text
3. The file-based organization of code is an artifact of human cognitive constraints

## Better Approaches for AI-Driven Development

Several alternative paradigms could better leverage AI's capabilities:

### Direct Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Manipulation
```
AI could work directly with structured code representations rather than generating text that must be parsed.
```

### Semantic Code Models
```python
# Instead of text files like this
def calculate_total(items):
    return sum(item.price for item in items)
```

AI could interact with semantic models representing the same functionality as relationships, constraints, and behaviors.

### Intent-Based Development Systems

Rather than writing code, developers could express intentions, and AI could:
- Understand the high-level goal
- Generate implementation automatically
- Reason about correctness without the text-based intermediate step

### API-Native Development

AI systems could interact directly with compilers, build systems, and deployment pipelines through purpose-built APIs rather than simulating human interaction patterns.

### Automated Verification Integration

AI-specific environments could integrate formal verification methods that continuously validate that generated code meets specifications.

## Concept

Traditional IDEs are designed for human developers with features like syntax highlighting, visual organization, and file-based structure. However, AI systems don't have the same cognitive constraints and can work with more abstract representations of code.

This project explores a new paradigm with:

1. **Intent-based Development**: Express what you want to build in natural language, and the AI interprets and implements it
2. **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Manipulation**: Direct work with code structure rather than text files
3. **Semantic Code Models**: Understanding code as relationships, constraints, and behaviors
4. **API-Native Development**: Direct interaction with compilers and build systems

## Architecture

The system consists of:

- **Intent Processor**: Interprets natural language development requests
- **AST Processor**: Works with abstract code representations
- **Semantic Model**: Maintains relationships between code entities
- **HTTP API Server**: Provides endpoints for client interaction
- **Web UI**: A simple interface to interact with the system
- **LLM Integration**: Uses OpenRouter API to connect to various AI models

### Model Selection

The system includes a model selection UI that allows you to:

1. View and select from all available models in OpenRouter (no API key required)
2. See model information including context length and pricing
3. Save your preferred model for future sessions

Model data is cached in your browser for 12 hours to improve performance.

### How It Works

1. **Intent Parsing**: Natural language intents are sent to the selected LLM, which parses them into structured representations
2. **Code Generation**: The LLM generates code based on the intent, along with AST and semantic representations
3. **Response Processing**: The system processes the LLM's response, extracting code, AST, and semantic information

## Future Directions

- Integration with real LLM services for more sophisticated intent parsing
- Live code generation and compilation
- Support for multiple programming languages
- Collaborative development features
- Integration with version control systems
